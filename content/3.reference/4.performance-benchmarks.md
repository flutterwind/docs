This page describes benchmark workflows for Flutterwind parser and variant resolution.

## Scope

- Parser throughput (`tokenizeFlutterWindClasses`, `applyClassToStyle`)
- Variant resolution path cost under repeated widget pumps

## Benchmark files

- `test/benchmarks/parser_benchmark.dart`
- `test/benchmarks/variant_benchmark.dart`

## Run locally

```sh
flutter test test/benchmarks/parser_benchmark.dart
flutter test test/benchmarks/variant_benchmark.dart
```

## Interpretation guidance

- Benchmarks are deterministic local checks, not cross-machine guarantees
- Compare deltas between commits on the same machine
- Treat regressions over ~20% as suspicious
- Re-run benchmarks multiple times before concluding regression
- Use DevTools profiling when regressions persist
