This page defines Flutterwind's public API stability contract.

## Public API surface

Stable public APIs include:

- `package:flutterwind_core/flutterwind.dart` exports
- `FlutterWindExtension.className(...)`
- `TailwindConfig` read APIs and config loading behavior
- `FlutterWindTheme` APIs

Anything under `lib/src/**` is internal unless explicitly re-exported through `flutterwind.dart`.

## Stability levels

- `stable`: production-safe; breaking changes require deprecation cycle
- `experimental`: may change in minor versions
- `internal`: no compatibility guarantees

## Deprecation workflow

Breaking changes to stable APIs must follow:

1. Add deprecation annotation and migration note
2. Keep old API functional for at least one minor release
3. Remove in the next major release only

## SemVer rules

- `PATCH`: bug fixes and internal improvements only
- `MINOR`: additive, non-breaking features
- `MAJOR`: breaking changes with migration guidance

## Migration docs expectations

For each deprecation/removal:

- mention old and new APIs
- include before/after code examples
- include target removal version
