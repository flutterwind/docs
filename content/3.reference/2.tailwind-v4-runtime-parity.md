title: Tailwind v4 Runtime Parity
description: Runtime parsing semantics, supported variants, and known constraints.

Flutterwind follows Tailwind-style parsing semantics for class strings.

## Semantic contract

- Last utility wins for the same property
- Variant chain uses AND semantics (`md:hover:*` applies only when both match)
- Runtime state variants supported: `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`
- Static variants supported: responsive keys, `dark:`, `light:`
- Unsupported variants/utilities are ignored and emit debug warnings

## Class parsing model

- Tokenization is bracket-aware to preserve arbitrary values
- Variant chains parse as `variant1:variant2:...:utility`
- Responsive evaluation uses `TailwindConfig.screens`

## Parity matrix

| Category | Status | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Utility precedence | supported | Last-write-wins behavior |
| Responsive variants (`sm`..`2xl`) | supported | Uses configured breakpoints |
| Dark mode variant (`dark:`) | supported | Uses current theme brightness |
| Light mode variant (`light:`) | supported | Inverse of dark mode |
| State variants (`hover/focus/active`) | supported | Runtime conditional application |
| Chained variants (`md:hover:*`) | supported | All conditions must match |
| Arbitrary spacing/sizing values | partial | Supports bracket forms like `w-[10rem]` |
| Arbitrary colors | partial | Supports forms like `bg-[#123456]` |
| CSS-only Tailwind v4 features | not supported | Ignored when no Flutter equivalent exists |

## Known constraints

- Some Tailwind CSS features are web/CSS-native and do not map 1:1 to Flutter
- Background image semantics require explicit image APIs in Flutterwind
- Utility breadth is evolving; verify with the support matrix page
