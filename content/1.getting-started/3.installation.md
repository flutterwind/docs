Flutterwind works across Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux.
:::

## 1) Add the package

:::code-group
```sh [Terminal]
flutter pub add flutterwind_core
```
:::

Or add it manually to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutterwind_core: latest_version
```

Then run:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

## 2) Initialize Flutterwind

```sh
flutter pub run flutterwind init
```

This creates a `flutterwind.yaml` file at your project root.  
Use this file to customize tokens like colors, spacing, breakpoints, typography, and effects.

## 3) Wrap your app

Import Flutterwind in `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutterwind_core/flutterwind.dart';
```

Wrap your app with `FlutterWind`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    FlutterWind(
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```
