## Why Goals & Non Goals?
Flutterwind was created by a small team with a defined set of goals and non-goals. These goals align closely with Tailwind CSS by also include the best principles for building universal applications.

## Goals

Flutterwind aims to enhance Flutter development by introducing a utility-first styling approach inspired by Tailwind CSS. The key goals of this project are:

- 🎯 **Utility-First Styling** – Provide a set of predefined styling utilities for quick and consistent UI development.
- ⚡ **Boost Developer Productivity** – Reduce boilerplate styling code and speed up UI building.
- 📦 **Lightweight & Performant** – Ensure minimal impact on app performance while maintaining flexibility.
- 🎨 **Customizability** – Allow developers to extend and override styles as needed.
- 📱 **Consistent Design System** – Encourage a structured approach to styling for maintainable and scalable apps.
- 🔌 **Seamless Integration** – Work smoothly with existing Flutter widgets without unnecessary complexity.

## Non-Goals

Flutterwind is not designed to replace all styling solutions in Flutter. Instead, it focuses on utility-first styling. The following are **not** within the scope of Flutterwind:

- ❌ **Replacing Flutter’s Widget System** – Flutterwind enhances styling but does not modify or replace how Flutter widgets work.
- ❌ **Providing a UI Component Library** – It does not include prebuilt UI components like buttons or cards; it only provides utility classes.
- ❌ **One-Size-Fits-All Solution** – It is meant to complement other styling approaches, not enforce a rigid design methodology.
- ❌ **Automatic Theme Detection** – Flutterwind does not dynamically adjust themes based on system settings (though it can be customized manually).
- ❌ **Heavy Custom Styling** – While customization is supported, the primary focus is on utility classes, not an extensive styling configuration system.
