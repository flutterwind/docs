Flutterwind includes CLI helpers for validation and docs generation.

## Validate utility classes

Use this in CI to catch invalid classes:

```sh
flutter pub run flutterwind_core validate --path lib --fail-on-error
```

## Generate support matrix

Regenerate the support matrix from runtime parser support lists:

```sh
flutter pub run flutterwind_core matrix --out doc/generated_support_matrix.md
```

## Run benchmark checks

```sh
flutter test test/benchmarks/parser_benchmark.dart
flutter test test/benchmarks/variant_benchmark.dart
```

## Golden parity checks

```sh
flutter test test/golden_widget_parity_test.dart --update-goldens
```

Use benchmark deltas as local regression signals. They are deterministic checks on your machine, not universal hardware guarantees.
