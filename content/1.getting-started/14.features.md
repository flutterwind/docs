## Core capabilities

- Utility-first styling with `.className('...')`
- Responsive breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`)
- Runtime variants (`dark:`, `light:`, `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`)
- Layout utilities (flex/grid, alignment, spacing, sizing)
- Typography utilities (size, weight, transform, decoration)
- Effects and transforms (shadow, blur, brightness, scale, rotate, translate)

## Advanced capabilities

- Accessibility helpers like `sr-only`, `focusable`, and focus-order utilities
- Performance-focused utilities like `lazy-load`, `cache`, and memory optimization flags
- Preset tokens (`btn`, `card`, `card-header`, `card-body`) and plugin extensibility

## Notes on support

Flutterwind is a Flutter runtime system, so not every CSS-only Tailwind feature maps 1:1.  
Check the `Reference` section for current support and constraints:

- `/reference/tailwind-v4-runtime-parity`
- `/reference/generated-support-matrix`
